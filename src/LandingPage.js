        No one knows exactly how or when coffee was discovered, though there are
        many legends about its origin.

      <h3>The History of Coffee</h3>
      <h4>An Ethiopian Legend</h4>
      <p>
        Coffee grown worldwide can trace its heritage back centuries to the
        ancient coffee forests on the Ethiopian plateau. There, legend says the
        goat herder Kaldi first discovered the potential of these beloved beans.
        The story goes that that Kaldi discovered coffee after he noticed that
        after eating the berries from a certain tree, his goats became so
        energetic that they did not want to sleep at night. Kaldi reported his
        findings to the abbot of the local monastery, who made a drink with the
        berries and found that it kept him alert through the long hours of
        evening prayer. The abbot shared his discovery with the other monks at
        the monastery, and knowledge of the energizing berries began to spread.
        As word moved east and coffee reached the Arabian peninsula, it began a
        journey which would bring these beans across the globe.
      </p>
      <h4>The Arabian Peninsula</h4>
      <p>
        Coffee cultivation and trade began on the Arabian Peninsula. By the 15th
        century, coffee was being grown in the Yemeni district of Arabia and by
        the 16th century it was known in Persia, Egypt, Syria, and Turkey.
        Coffee was not only enjoyed in homes, but also in the many public coffee
        houses — called qahveh khaneh — which began to appear in cities across
        the Near East. The popularity of the coffee houses was unequaled and
        people frequented them for all kinds of social activity. Not only did
        the patrons drink coffee and engage in conversation, but they also
        listened to music, watched performers, played chess and kept current on
        the news. Coffee houses quickly became such an important center for the
        exchange of information that they were often referred to as “Schools of
        the Wise.” With thousands of pilgrims visiting the holy city of Mecca
        each year from all over the world, knowledge of this “wine of Araby”
        began to spread.
